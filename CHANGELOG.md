# Changelog

All notable public changes to Entropy are tracked here.

Entropy uses public release versions for GitHub releases and internal build versions
for development history. The first public beta is `v0.1.0-beta.1`.

## Unreleased

### Main Features

- Added Key Heatmap: opt-in local press statistics per keyboard and layer, shown as a thermal map with key-to-key routes on each half of a split keyboard and an activity calendar; only counters are stored, never typed text

## v0.4.0 - Public Beta

### Main Features

- Added full M4CR0Pad firmware 4.0.6 display customization: standby images and animations, startup images, clocks and dates, 32×32 pictograms, macro and Tap Dance assignments, and synchronized host previews
- Added an adaptive symbol typing trainer that follows the active layout and prioritizes characters with more errors
- Added a Nix flake with declarative NixOS and Home Manager modules

### Improvements

- Added GUI chords to Mod-Tap choices and readable labels for Layer Lock
- Added a dedicated label for firmware auto-layer deactivation on key press
- Kept Matrix Tester geometry below the header, honored active layout options, and decoded firmware rows consistently
- Allowed Layer-Tap and Mod-Tap keys as Key Override and RMK Fork triggers while continuing to reject invalid trigger values
- Added bounded, serialized HID ownership for background display updates across keyboard switches and reconnects

### Fixes

- Restored wired QMK/Vial loading for legacy VIA responses and made unsupported compatibility probes fail fast
- Restored update checks after transient GitHub API failures and kept the pinned Layout Indicator visible
- Kept wired keyboards discoverable after unplugging and reconnecting them
- Preserved M4CR0Pad clocks when switching Entropy to another Ergohaven keyboard over USB or Bluetooth
- Kept pictogram saves on the active editor page, waited for firmware 4.0.6 flash commits, and prevented stale or failed transfers from corrupting confirmed state
- Strengthened USB/Bluetooth device identity, HID owner fencing, reconnect drafts, secure Vial unlock handling, and shutdown ordering

## v0.3.21-rc.7 - Test Candidate

### Fixes

- Keep the M4CR0Pad clock alive when Entropy switches to a different Ergohaven keyboard over Bluetooth by recognizing the devices as separate product families across transports

## v0.3.21-rc.6 - Test Candidate

### Fixes

- Keep pictogram slot commits on firmware 4.0.6 within their flash-write response window instead of treating them as a disconnect and reloading the whole keyboard
- Keep macropad clocks alive when selecting another physical keyboard by transferring the existing HID owner directly to the background host-data bridge
- Keep pictogram editing visible during a slot save and distinguish saving one slot from reading the full library

## v0.3.21-rc.4 - Test Candidate

### Fixes

- Distinguish Linux USB device parents when Vial keyboards report the same generic serial, preserving separate background display owners while keeping composite interfaces exclusively reserved
- Reject USB fallback to another physical parent with the same model and serial
- Add metadata-only diagnostics for pictogram transfers, unlock operations and per-device clock workers; the reported second-upload hardware failure remains under investigation

## v0.3.21-rc.2 - Test Candidate

### Fixes

- Allowed Layer-Tap and Mod-Tap keys as triggers in the shared QMK Key Override and RMK Fork editor while keeping empty, transparent, and plain-modifier triggers unavailable

## v0.3.21-rc.1 - Test Candidate

### Fixes

- Restored wired QMK-Vial loading for legacy VIA protocol replies and made unsupported RMK capability and Vial dynamic-entry probes fail fast

## v0.3.20 - Public Beta

### Main Features

- Added queued middle-click assignment for keys and encoder slots, with per-action undo and an application setting to choose `None` or `Transparent`

### Improvements

- Added an application setting that makes middle click assign `Transparent` instead of `None`, including queued key and encoder writes with matching layout hints
- Exposed RMK Repeat/Again in the Special picker independently from the unsupported Alt Repeat slots

### Fixes

- Removed the unavailable right-click Mouse Keys action when connected firmware does not expose Mouse Keys settings

## v0.3.20-rc.5 - Test Candidate

### Fixes

- Kept Layout Indicator responsive when the main Entropy window is minimized on native GNOME Wayland by pacing non-blocking swaps for every Wayland viewport at the monitor refresh rate

## v0.3.20-rc.4 - Test Candidate

### Fixes

- Kept the main Entropy window interactive when Layout Indicator is minimized or covered on native GNOME Wayland by preventing secondary viewports from blocking the shared renderer

## v0.3.20-rc.3 - Test Candidate

### Fixes

- Decoupled the Layout Indicator into an independent deferred viewport so minimizing it cannot suspend pointer input or hover updates in the main Entropy window

## v0.3.20-rc.2 - Test Candidate

### Improvements

- Matched the Macro and Tap Dance slot dialogs to the compact Choose Layer window pattern

### Fixes

- Restored the Layout Indicator viewport to eframe's UI phase so focus transfers cannot paint through the logic-only lifecycle
- Reserved square inline slots for Text Expander Twemoji and kept the emoji-picker trigger monochrome

## v0.3.20-rc.1 - Test Candidate

### Improvements

- Moved Macro and Tap Dance assignment into the first Special-key group and removed the separate Advanced picker tab
- Made Macro and Tap Dance lists and slot dialogs adapt to available window space, including localized action labels
- Rendered Text Expander picker choices and replacement-field emoji with the bundled color Twemoji assets

### Fixes

- Kept Layout Indicator polling in the root background lifecycle and repainted its viewport only after fresh matrix data, preventing focus-return freezes
- Normalized emoji presentation selectors before Twemoji lookup so the smiling-face picker entry no longer falls back to the old font

## v0.3.19-rc.1 - Test Candidate

### Improvements

- Rebuilt Macro actions as sequential in-section slots and anchored shared page actions outside scrolling content
- Aligned Advanced Macro and Tap Dance choices with the compact picker controls and restored interaction after closing slot selection with Escape
- Added persistent Linux IBus installation detection and corrected Entropy input-source names

### Fixes

- Removed the repeated keymap-read timeout on incompatible QMK/Vial devices and added a fail-fast per-key compatibility path
- Rejected modifier keycodes as Key Override triggers and disabled invalid stored overrides before they can consume regular input

## v0.3.10 - Public Beta

### Improvements

- Added middle click on a key or encoder to clear it to `None` without opening the picker, with queued writes so fast repeated clearing keeps up

### Fixes

- Kept Windows automatic startup hidden in the system tray after eframe's first-frame window reveal
