Entropy is a desktop app with a modern, minimalist, and intuitive interface for
configuring programmable input devices running Vial-QMK or Vial-RMK firmware:
split keyboards, macropads, trackballs, touchpad modules, and other hardware
that exposes keyboard-style firmware features through HID.

It is designed to feel direct and predictable: connect a device, pick it from the
device list, and work through layout, keycodes, macros, lighting, pointing controls,
and firmware settings from one coherent interface.

## Platforms

| Platform | Status | Package |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux x86_64 | Primary target | AppImage |
| Windows x86_64 | Release target | Portable EXE |
| macOS arm64 (Apple Silicon) | Release target | Unsigned DMG |
| macOS x86_64 (Intel) | Release target | Unsigned DMG |

Public builds are published for Linux, Windows, and macOS. macOS builds are
unsigned and not notarized for now.

## Downloads

Release builds are published on the
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ergohaven/entropy/releases) page:

- `entropy-v0.4.0-x86_64.AppImage`
- `entropy-v0.4.0-windows-x86_64.exe`
- `entropy-v0.4.0-macos-arm64.dmg`
- `entropy-v0.4.0-macos-x86_64.dmg`

Stable tags such as `v0.4.0` publish a regular GitHub release and mark it as
latest. Tags with a suffix, such as `v0.4.0-rc.1`, publish the same artifacts as
a GitHub prerelease.

Windows builds are unsigned for now, so Windows SmartScreen may warn before
launching the app.

macOS DMG builds are unsigned and not notarized for now. On Apple Silicon,
use the `macos-arm64` build; the `macos-x86_64` build is for Intel Macs. To run
a downloaded DMG on macOS:

1. Open the `.dmg`
2. Drag `Entropy.app` to `/Applications`
3. Remove the quarantine flag:

```sh
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Entropy.app
```

4. Launch Entropy:

```sh
open /Applications/Entropy.app
```

## Quick Start

1. Download the build for your platform from GitHub Releases
2. Connect a Vial-compatible device
3. On Linux, install Vial udev rules if Entropy cannot open the device
   and install the IBus backend if you want Text Expander on Linux
4. Launch Entropy
5. Select the device from the top-left device dropdown
6. Edit layers, keycodes, advanced firmware features, or app settings
7. Save/write changes when the edited feature requires it

## Headless Layout Export

Scripts and backup jobs can save a keyboard's `.entlayout` without opening a
window:

```sh
entropy --export-layout k04.entlayout
entropy --export-layout - --device "K:04 (Qube)" > k04.entlayout
```

The file is the same one **Layout → Export layout** writes. `--device` picks
the keyboard when several are attached, by a part of its name, a hex `VID:PID`
such as `e126:0071`, or its HID path; `--timeout` (seconds, default 60) bounds
both the wait for a Bluetooth keyboard to be discovered and its loading. Close
the Entropy window first: the export refuses to run next to another instance
that owns the keyboard.

The export is read-only: the HID transport refuses every command that would
change the keyboard. It writes only a complete snapshot of one connection: if a
section fails to load or the keyboard reconnects midway, nothing is written. A
file destination is replaced atomically, so a failed run keeps the previous
backup.

Exit status: `0` exported, `1` export failed, `2` no or ambiguous keyboard,
`3` another Entropy instance is running, `4` incomplete (the missing sections
are logged), `64` usage error.

## Linux Device Access

Vial devices use hidraw access on Linux. If your device appears but cannot be opened,
use the **Install Vial udev rules** action in Entropy settings, or install the
included udev rule manually from a source checkout:

```sh
./linux/udev/install-vial-rules.sh
```

Replug the device after installing the rule.

## Linux IBus Backend

On Linux, Entropy uses IBus for Text Expander input. Use
the **Install IBus** action in Entropy settings to install the bundled Entropy
IBus engine. The AppImage includes the installer and engine, so a separate source
checkout is not required.

IBus itself and its Python bindings must still be installed by the system package
manager. On Debian/Ubuntu-like systems:

```sh
sudo apt-get install ibus python3-gi gir1.2-ibus-1.0
```

After installation, restart IBus if Entropy did not do it automatically, then add
an **Entropy Text Expander** layout as an input source in your desktop input settings.

## NixOS

A flake is included. Run without installing:

```sh
nix run github:ergohaven/entropy
```

The in-app setup actions cannot work on NixOS: **Install Vial udev rules**
writes to `/etc/udev/rules.d`, and IBus loads engines only from its own store
path, so a copy under `~/.local/share` is never picked up. Use the NixOS module
instead, which covers both declaratively:

```nix
{
  inputs.entropy.url = "github:ergohaven/entropy";

  outputs = { nixpkgs, entropy, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations.myhost = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      modules = [
        entropy.nixosModules.default
        { programs.entropy.enable = true; }
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

This installs the app and the Vial hidraw udev rule. Nothing else is touched:
no input method is enabled or selected on your behalf.

Text Expander needs the Entropy IBus engine, which is opt-in and expects IBus
to be the input method you already run:

```nix
{
  programs.entropy = {
    enable = true;
    ibus.enable = true;
  };

  i18n.inputMethod = {
    enable = true;
    type = "ibus";
  };
}
```

Enabling `programs.entropy.ibus` while some other input method is active only
produces a warning — the engine is never loaded in that case. Universal Symbols
need no input method at all on firmware that exposes native RMK key actions.

After rebuilding, add **Entropy Text Expander** — or a layout-specific variant,
e.g. **Entropy Text Expander EN** — as an input source. Entropy detects an
engine registered this way and replaces the **Install IBus** action with
**Reload IBus registry**: a daemon started before the rebuild still serves its
old registry, so the new layouts show up only after it reloads (or after you
log out and back in).

`programs.entropy.group` (default `entropy`) is the dedicated group the udev
rule grants access to. It is created automatically. Active local sessions
normally receive access through uaccess; add users that also need direct
hidraw access outside the active seat (for example over SSH) explicitly:

```nix
users.users.alice.extraGroups = [ "entropy" ];
```

nixpkgs ships its own `programs.entropy` module around `pkgs.ergohaven-entropy`.
Both declare the same option, so this module disables the nixpkgs one
(`disabledModules`) and takes over: it follows the version in this repository
and exposes `package`, `group` and the `ibus` options. Use one or the other,
not both — importing this module is what makes the choice.

A `homeManagerModules.default` is also available, but the udev rule needs root,
so it only covers the app and the IBus engine, and its IBus registration works
only under standalone home-manager.

Development shell with the toolchain and native dependencies:

```sh
nix develop
```

## Universal Symbols

Universal Symbols are native RMK firmware actions for punctuation that should
produce the same character in English and Russian layouts. Supported firmware
tracks the active EN/RU layout and emits ordinary HID key presses, so assigned
symbols work without Entropy or another background service.

When Entropy is running, the existing Layout Sync bridge reports the active OS
layout to the keyboard and corrects firmware state after layout changes made by
the operating system. Manual Toggle, Sync, English, and Russian actions remain
available for fully autonomous use.

Entropy shows the Universal Symbols picker section only when connected firmware
advertises this capability. The catalog intentionally contains only punctuation
implemented by the firmware; the former Unicode typography, arrows, math, and
currency extras are not exposed.

## Compatibility

Entropy currently communicates with Vial-compatible HID devices. Its UI is designed
for programmable keyboards and adjacent input devices such as macropads, trackballs,
touchpads, and encoder/display modules when those features are exposed by firmware.

Best-tested hardware is Ergohaven hardware and Vial-compatible QMK/RMK-style devices.
Firmware support varies by device; Entropy hides firmware-gated pages when the
connected device does not expose the required capability.

Not in scope for this release:

- Browser-only configuration
- Mobile platforms

## Development

Install a stable Rust toolchain, then build the desktop app:

```sh
cargo run
cargo build --release
```

Linux builds require native GUI/HID dependencies. On Debian/Ubuntu-like systems:

```sh
sudo apt-get install \
  libhidapi-dev \
  libudev-dev \
  libxcb-render0-dev \
  libxcb-shape0-dev \
  libxcb-xfixes0-dev \
  libxkbcommon-dev \
  libssl-dev \
  libgtk-3-dev
```

Build a macOS app bundle and DMG on macOS:

```sh
scripts/build_macos_app.sh
```

Build a Windows release binary from Linux with the GNU target:

```sh
cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```
